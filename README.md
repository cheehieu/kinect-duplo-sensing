kinect-duplo-sensing
====================

ROS package for identifying Duplo blocks with the Microsoft Kinect sensor

Developed in Fall 2011 for the Sensing & Planning in Robotics (CSCI 545) course at USC.

Used ROS and the PR2-simulator to obtain point cloud data from a robot-head-mounted Microsoft Kinect sensor.  Segmented Duplo blocks by color and size to identify block orientation and perform robotic manipulation tasks.
